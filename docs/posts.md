## 📌 POST 1 — Launch / Introduction

**Title:** Meet JobSensei — Your AI Job Hunt Companion ☕🤖

**Body:**

Hey! I built something I really wish existed when I was job hunting.

**JobSensei** is a free, browser-based app that gives you a full AI toolkit for your job search — without the corporate pricing, without handing over your data, and without a million different tabs open.

Here's what's inside:

🎤 **Interview Simulator** — Practice with an AI hiring manager. 4 modes: HR screen, Technical, Competency-Based, Stress Interview. Real questions based on the actual job description you paste in.

🔍 **Gap Analysis** — Paste any job posting + your background → get a fit score, top strengths, key gaps, and a red flag detector that spots sketchy JD language.

💰 **Negotiation Simulator** — Practice salary negotiation before the real call. Roleplay against an AI recruiter. Get a debrief on what you did right and what you left on the table.

⭐ **STAR Builder** — Dump your rough story notes in, get a polished interview answer out. Builds your personal Story Bank.

📚 **Learning** — AI tutor + spaced repetition quizzes. Actually learn the stuff, don't just skim it.

🛠️ **11 Tools** — Cover letters, resume checker, elevator pitch, LinkedIn auditor, follow-up emails, question predictor... it's a lot.

📋 **Job Tracker** — Kanban board for every application. Company notes wiki. Export your data anytime.

**Privacy-first:** No account needed. No backend. Your data lives in your browser.

**Free to use** with your own API key (OpenAI, Claude, DeepSeek — costs literally pennies per session). Or support here on Buy Me a Coffee and get instant access — no API key needed ☕

If you're job hunting right now, this is for you. Try it, break it, tell me what you think.

## 📌 POST 2 — Interview Simulator Deep Dive

**Title:** I Built an AI That Interviews You. Harshly. 🔱

**Body:**

Real talk: most people go into interviews under-prepared. Not because they're not smart — because they never actually practice *out loud*, under pressure, with real follow-up questions.

So I added two modes to JobSensei's Interview Simulator:

🏯 **Sensei Mode** — Warm, constructive coaching. Great for confidence-building and learning the format.

🔱 **Drill Mode** — Brutal. Honest. The AI pushes back, pokes holes in your answers, and doesn't let vague responses slide.

Drill mode is uncomfortable. That's the point.

You paste the job description → the AI generates real questions from it → you answer (type or speak) → it evaluates your response → it asks follow-ups → at the end, you get a full debrief with scores.

The AI interviewer is named Jordan Mitchell and she does NOT hand out participation trophies.

4 interview types:
- 🤝 HR Screen (culture fit, motivation)
- 💻 Technical Panel (hard skills from the JD)
- 🧩 Competency-Based (STAR behavioral questions)
- 😤 Stress Interview (devil's advocate, pushback, weird questions)

Every session is saved so you can track improvement over time.

## 📌 POST 3 — Gap Analysis / Red Flags

**Title:** Stop Applying Blindly 🛑 Know Your Score First

**Body:**

Here's a habit that will save you hours of wasted applications:

Before you hit "Apply" → run the job description through Gap Analysis.

JobSensei's Gap Analysis tool does three things:

**1️⃣ Gap Analysis**
Paste the JD + your background. Get:
- Fit score (0–100%)
- Your top strengths for this role
- Your key gaps (with an action plan)
- Whether you should actually apply

**2️⃣ Application Scoring**
Beyond fit — it scores your *application* specifically. Great Fit? Stretch? Long Shot? You'll know before you invest the time.

**3️⃣ Red Flag Detector 🚩**
This one's underrated. It reads the JD for:
- Toxic culture signals ("we work hard and play hard" 🙄)
- Unrealistic expectations ("5+ years in a 3-year-old framework")
- Vague compensation ("competitive salary")
- Signs of high turnover or poor management

Know what you're walking into *before* the interview.

Everything saves to your project, so you build a history of analyses and can compare roles side-by-side.

## 📌 POST 4 — Negotiation Simulator

**Title:** The Average Person Leaves $5–10K on the Table 💸

**Body:**

Salary negotiation is a skill. And like any skill, you get better by practicing — not by winging it during an actual job offer call when your hands are shaking.

JobSensei's **Negotiation Simulator** lets you practice before the stakes are real.

Here's how it works:

You enter:
- The initial offer they made
- Your target salary
- The role and context

Then you negotiate in real-time chat against an AI recruiter named **Alex Chen**. Alex plays it realistic — not a pushover, not unreasonable. Exactly the kind of conversation you'd actually have.

Practice:
- 📌 Anchoring high
- 🔄 Countering effectively
- 🎯 Asking for non-salary perks when base is stuck
- ✅ Closing confidently

After the session, you get a full debrief:
- What you did well
- What tactics you missed
- What you could have said differently

One good negotiation = potential 5-figure difference in your career earnings. Practice costs nothing.

## 📌 POST 5 — Privacy & Why It's Different

**Title:** No Account. No Backend. Your Data Stays Yours. 🔒

**Body:**

Most career tools want your email, your resume, your work history — and then they sell you ads or a premium plan.

JobSensei works differently.

Here's what it does NOT do:
- ❌ Require you to create an account
- ❌ Store your data on a server
- ❌ Sell or share your information
- ❌ Lock you into one AI provider
- ❌ Put features behind a paywall unless you want the easy setup

Here's what it DOES do:
- ✅ Run entirely in your browser (localStorage only)
- ✅ Work with your own API key (OpenAI, Claude, DeepSeek, or custom)
- ✅ Let you export your data anytime (CSV, JSON)
- ✅ Delete everything with one button if you want
- ✅ Offer BMAC supporter access if you don't want to deal with API keys

Your resume, your interview history, your application notes — none of it leaves your device.

In a world where your career data is sensitive, that actually matters.

## 📌 POST 7 — Story / Personal Note

**Title:** Why I Built This ☕

**Body:**

I built JobSensei because I was frustrated.

I was job hunting and kept hitting the same walls:
- AI tools that cost $30/month for basic features
- Interview prep that was generic (not based on *my* background or *the actual JD*)
- No way to practice negotiation without doing it live and messing it up
- Five different apps for five different things
- Apps that wanted my email before I could do anything

So I built the thing I wanted.

One app. Browser only. AI-powered. No backend. No account. Free if you have an API key.

Six months later, JobSensei has:
- 🎤 Interview Simulator (4 modes, voice input, debrief scoring)
- 🔍 Gap Analysis + Red Flag Detector
- 💰 Negotiation Roleplay
- ⭐ STAR Story Builder
- 📚 AI Tutor + Spaced Repetition Quizzes
- 🛠️ 11 Tools (cover letters, resume checker, LinkedIn auditor, and more)
- 📋 Kanban Job Tracker with company notes

If you're in a job search right now — this is for you.

And if you find it useful, supporting on Buy Me a Coffee keeps the lights on and the AI running ☕

## 📌 POST 8 — Quick Tips Style (great for carousels / captions)

**Title:** 5 Things Most People Get Wrong in Job Interviews 🎤

**Body:**

Practiced this stuff with JobSensei's AI and realized how common these mistakes are:

**1. Answering what was asked, not what was meant**
When they ask "tell me about yourself," they don't want your life story. They want: who you are professionally + why you're here + why you're good at this. Practice that.

**2. Vague "team player" answers**
Generic adjectives don't land. Specific stories do. "I collaborated well" = forgettable. "I caught a £200K fraud pattern my team missed by building a quick analysis in Python" = memorable. Build your Story Bank.

**3. Never researching the red flags in the JD**
That "fast-paced environment with a wear-many-hats approach" might mean underfunded and chaotic. Read the JD critically. Run it through a Red Flag Detector if you can.

**4. Skipping salary practice**
Most people don't counter because they're scared. Counter with confidence because you practiced. Even once. Even with an AI.

**5. Not tracking their applications**
You applied to 30 roles and forgot half of them. You missed a follow-up. You showed up to the interview not remembering your own notes. A Kanban board fixes this in 10 minutes.
