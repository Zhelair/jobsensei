## 🚫 What NOT to Say

- Don't say it "replaces" real career coaches (it complements them)
- Don't oversell the data privacy angle — just state the facts (no backend, localStorage only)
- Don't call it "perfect" — frame it as a powerful tool, not a magic solution
- Don't focus only on one feature — the strength is the complete toolkit
